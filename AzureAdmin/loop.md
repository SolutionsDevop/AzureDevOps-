Deploy Virtual Networks (VNet) Using a Loop

You have been provided with an existing Bicep file named loop-vnet.bicep located at /root/bicep-template/. This file is intended to deploy multiple Virtual Networks (VNets) but contains some issues. Your task is to correct the Bicep code and ensure it can successfully deploy three Virtual Networks (VNets) within a resource group named aa-loop using a loop.
Requirements

    Address Range: Each VNet should have the same address range: 10.10.0.0/16.
    VNet Naming: The VNets should be named kk-loop-vnet- followed by the iteration number. This means your VNets should be named:
        aa-loop-vnet-1
        aa-loop-vnet-2
        aa-loop-vnet-3
    Location: Each VNet must be deployed in the same location as the resource group.

Additional Notes

    Ensure the loop-vnet.bicep file is error-free and ready for deployment. We might cross verify, so don't use portal.
    Deployment: Use the Azure CLI to deploy the updated template. The deployment command format is as follows:


The code snippet provided below demonstrates a loop in Azure Bicep to create multiple storage accounts with a similar naming convention. Letâ€™s break down and understand this snippet in detail.
Detailed Breakdown of the Bicep Code

resource storageaccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-02-01' = [for i in range(0, 3): {
  name: '${i}appstore443443'
  location: 'North Europe'
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
}]

1. Resource Declaration

    resource storageaccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-02-01':
        This line defines a resource of type Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts using the API version 2021-02-01.
        The storageaccount is the name assigned to this resource within the Bicep file.

2. Looping Syntax

    [for i in range(0, 3): {...}]:
        The loop iterates from 0 to 2 (total of 3 iterations). The range(0, 3) function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, 3.
        The variable i takes the value 0, 1, and 2 in each iteration of the loop.

3. Resource Properties in the Loop

    name: '${i}appstore443443':
        This property dynamically creates the name of each storage account by concatenating the loop index i with the string appstore443443.
        For example, the storage account names generated would be 0appstore443443, 1appstore443443, and 2appstore443443.

    location: 'North Europe':
        The location for all storage accounts is set to 'North Europe'. This means all three storage accounts will be deployed in the North Europe region.

    kind: 'StorageV2':
        The kind property defines the type of storage account. StorageV2 is a general-purpose v2 account, offering the latest features.

    sku: { name: 'Standard_LRS' }:
        The Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) specifies the pricing tier and replication strategy. In this case, Standard_LRS stands for Locally Redundant Storage, which replicates data three times within a single region.

Summary

This Bicep code creates three storage accounts in the North Europe region, with names following the pattern ${i}appstore443443, where i ranges from 0 to 2. All storage accounts are of type StorageV2 and use the Standard_LRS SKU.
Key Points to Note

    Dynamic Naming: The use of the loop index i allows for dynamic creation of resource names, ensuring uniqueness within the deployment.
    Scalability: By simply changing the range, you can increase or decrease the number of storage accounts deployed without having to manually repeat code.
    Consistency: The location, kind, and SKU properties are consistent across all storage accounts, making the deployment predictable and uniform.

This approach is efficient for deploying multiple resources with slight variations, such as different names, while keeping the rest of the properties consistent.
